## ArrayList Operations Project
Developed by senagulen üèÜ
## Overview
This project implements specialized operations on **ArrayLists** in Java, including deduplication, set intersection, and set difference. The goal is to enhance list processing skills while working with **generic data types** and adhering to Java's best practices.

## Learning Objectives
- Apply **looping and conditional statements** to solve method specifications.
- Gain experience working with **generic types** (`<T>`).
- Understand **list operations** such as deduplication and set operations.
- Debug and test Java programs using **JUnit**.

## Features
The project includes the following key methods in `ArrayListServices.java`:
1. **`deduplicate()`** ‚Äì Removes duplicate elements from an ArrayList.
2. **`getSetIntersection()`** ‚Äì Returns common elements between two ArrayLists.
3. **`getSetDifference()`** ‚Äì Returns elements that exist in one list but not in the other.

These methods allow for efficient list processing while ensuring that the original lists remain unmodified.
